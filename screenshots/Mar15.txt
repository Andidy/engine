1: I've simplified the code neccesary to render game entities and different models and textures
   and Added simple tree placement to game map procedural generation code and added a water layer to the map
2: Shows adding more of the debug models to the easy entity drawing code
3: not shown, but tested most of functionality of new game map functions (still need to test the wrapping behavior)
